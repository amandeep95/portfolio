              <h4>Background</h4>
              <p class="proj_process">The core requirements of this project was to create an application which has several screens and activities within itself. After brainstorming with my team, we agreed on the concept of the app, which should be a database that runs on user input for a list of animals that the user has seen in the wild. My roles in the team were to code the application and design it along the way.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="Proj_description">
              <h4>Initial Sketches</h4>
              <p class="proj_process">We first began by sketching layouts of the app screens, and placing them in the order that they would appear as a user uses it. I later took those sketches and cleaned them up in Illustrator for more clarity, and so that the rest of my team would be able to fully commit to the design.</p>

            <div class="Proj_description">
              <h4>Prototype</h4>
              <p class="proj_process">From the designs created, I then coded a prototype of the application, to check that the basic functionality was working. This would include things such as the user being able to create an account, add an animal to the Andex and perform an internet search on the animal they have entered. At this stage the appearance was not a top priority as it could be changed later once the functionality was all complete.</p>

            <div class="Proj_description">
              <h4>Full Functionality</h4>
              <p class="proj_process">With all that information taken into account, we headed to the final assembly of the app, will all of its functionality and UI design competed. I added and took away certain features and screens due to an approaching deadline, and needing it to be a completed app in the end. Features such as the devices location being used automatically so that the user wouldnâ€™t have to, was removed because of time constraints. But I was able to implement the use of the devices camera, so that the user is able to take a photograph of the animal and then add it to their database.</p>

            <div class="Proj_description">
              <h4>Final Result</h4>
              <p class="proj_process">The finished result was a neat and functional application which lets users create a log-in ID and during further log-ins use previously stored ones. The app also allowed them to choose what action they wanted to proceed with, such as adding an animal they have spotted; browsing the list of animals they have already added; and creating/searching the list for a specific type they have previously entered.</p>
