              <h4>Background</h4>
              <p class="proj_process"><strong>Brobobots: Terminating Termination</strong> is a 3rd person Top-down 2.5D, local co-op puzzle game set in a fictional futuristic setting. The game involves two players controlling the protagonists Dink and Megapixel by utilizing each of their unique abilities to help one another through obstacles and solving puzzles to escape confinement.</p>

              <p class="proj_process">Megapixels abilites include melee punches, a rocket fist and he can pick up and throw objects, enemies and even Dink! Dinks abilites allow him to headbutt enemies, blast them with an EMP and mindcontrol them to fight other enemies and solve puzzles.</p>

              <h4>Brainstorming / Prototyping</h4>  <!-- Prototyping -->
              <p class="proj_process">The first prototype I built focused on the core mechanics our game, mainly the abilities of the players and how they will be used against enemies. </p>

              <h4>Playable Prototype</h4> <!-- Alpha Code -->
              <p class="proj_process">Our first playable prototype was coded with half of the functionality by me with sprites provided by another member of the team. Gameplay allowed for player movement, object interaction, on-screen dialogue and simple NPC (non-player character) movement across 4 different environments.</p>

              <h4>Playtesting</h4> <!-- Beta Code -->
              <p class="proj_process">During our playtesting stage we uncovered many issues in our GUI (graphical user interface), which participants confused our play testers on what their objectives in the game were. We fixed this by updating the hierarchy on the GUI with the objective always present on screen in a non-distracting fashion.</p>

              <h4>Future Iterations</h4> <!-- Gold Code Showcase -->
              <p class="proj_process">But since this was a 3-4 weeks project, we were unable to incorporate finishing features to the game, such as player animations during speech, cutscenes between levels and at the beginning of the game, as well as perfecting the AI movement of the NPC.</p>
