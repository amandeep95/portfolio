            </div>

            <div class="Proj_description">
              <h4>Background</h4>
              <p class="proj_process">The Murphey Frame is a 2D narrative based game created for a Foundations of Game Design course in Unity using C# language over the course of 4 weeks. This project was created in a team of three, and my role was to brainstorm initial ideas, create the story/script for the final concept and code all the playable elements of the game.</p>

          <div class="Project_Reverse">

            <div class="Proj_img">
              <img src="img/P1/P1_2.jpg" alt="Initial stortyboard sketches of the game plot." class="Project_img">
            </div>

            <div class="Proj_description">
              <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
              <p class="proj_process">During the initial brainstorming session, we had decided on the tone and aesthetic of the game to be 2D and pixelated with a darker tone, and the narrative of the game to follow a young boy, James, who is transported from present day to 1960â€™s London via a cursed photo frame, there he meets a serial killer Cyrus Murphey who he can choose to help to alter the future. From this we planned out the 9-act arc the game would follow, and I was tasked with the creation of the script elements such as dialogue and actions.</p>

            <div class="Proj_description">
              <h4>Playable Prototype</h4>
              <p class="proj_process">Our first playable prototype was coded with half of the functionality by me with sprites provided by another member of the team. Gameplay allowed for player movement, object interaction, on-screen dialogue and simple NPC (non-player character) movement across 4 different environments.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="Proj_description">
              <h4>Playtesting</h4>
              <p class="proj_process">During our playtesting stage we uncovered many issues in our GUI (graphical user interface), which participants confused our play testers on what their objectives in the game were. We fixed this by updating the hierarchy on the GUI with the objective always present on screen in a non-distracting fashion.</p>

            <div class="Proj_description">
              <h4>Future Iterations</h4>
              <p class="proj_process">But since this was a 3-4 weeks project, we were unable to incorporate finishing features to the game, such as player animations during speech, cutscenes between levels and at the beginning of the game, as well as perfecting the AI movement of the NPC.</p>
